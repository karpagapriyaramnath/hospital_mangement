## 📌 API Endpoints

### 👨‍⚕️ Doctors

* POST `/doctors/`
* GET `/doctors/`
* PUT `/doctors/{id}`
* DELETE `/doctors/{id}`
* PATCH `/doctors/{id}/activate`
* PATCH `/doctors/{id}/deactivate`

---

### 🧑 Patients

* POST `/patients/`
* GET `/patients/`
* PUT `/patients/{id}`
* DELETE `/patients/{id}`

---

### 📅 Appointments

* POST `/appointments/`
* GET `/appointments/`
* GET `/appointments/doctor/{id}`
* GET `/appointments/patient/{id}`
* PATCH `/appointments/{id}/cancel`
* PATCH `/appointments/{id}/complete`

---

## 🧠 Business Logic

* ❌ Cannot book appointment with inactive doctor
* ❌ Cannot complete cancelled appointment
* ❌ Cannot cancel completed appointment
* ✔ Only authenticated users can access APIs

---

## 📄 Example Request (Create Appointment)

```json
{
  "doctor_id": 1,
  "patient_id": 1,
  "appointment_date": "2026-04-25"
